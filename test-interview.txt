This is a test interview transcript. Interviewer: Hi Sarah, how are you today? Sarah: I am doing well, thank you for asking. Interviewer: Can you tell us about your experience with project management tools? Sarah: I have been using various tools for about 3 years now. I started with Trello but found it too simple for complex projects. Then I tried Asana, which was better but still had some issues with team collaboration. The biggest problem was that team members would forget to update their status, so I would have to chase them down constantly. Also, the reporting features were pretty basic - I could not get the insights I needed to track project progress effectively. Interviewer: What would make this better for you? Sarah: I would love a tool that automatically tracks progress without requiring manual updates. Maybe something that integrates with our existing tools and provides better analytics. Also, it would be great if it could send smart notifications to team members when they need to take action.
